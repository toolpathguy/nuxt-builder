Git Branching and Merge Workflow
Rules
NEVER commit directly to main. All work MUST happen on a branch.

Before starting any new work, create a branch off main using one of these prefixes:

feat/ — new features or functionality
chore/ — cleanup, refactoring, UI polish, dependency updates
fix/ — bug fixes
Example: git checkout -b feat/barcode-improvements

Make as many commits as needed on the branch. Use clear, descriptive commit messages.

When the work is complete and ready to merge:

Push the branch to origin: git push -u origin <branch-name>
Create a Pull Request via the GitHub MCP targeting main
The PR body MUST start with Fixes #<issue-number> or Relates to #<issue-number> referencing the original GitHub issue
Do NOT merge locally — merging happens through the PR on GitHub
NEVER squash-merge locally with git merge --squash. NEVER run git merge against main. All merges happen through Pull Requests on GitHub.

Do NOT rebase onto main. All integration happens through PRs.

If the user asks to "commit" while on a feature branch, commit to the current branch. Only create a PR when the user explicitly asks to merge, says they are done, or says to create a PR.

Commit Timing — Batch Over Noise
Do NOT commit and push after every small change. When going back and forth with the user on iterative refinements (tweaks, fixes, adjustments, review feedback), let changes accumulate as unstaged work on the branch.

Wait for a natural completion point before committing. Good commit points:

A coherent feature or fix is working end-to-end
The user says "that looks good", "ship it", "commit", or similar
A spec task is fully complete (not just partially done)
You're about to switch context to a different area of the codebase
When in doubt, do NOT commit. It's always better to batch related changes into one meaningful commit than to litter the history with "fix typo", "adjust padding", "oops try again" noise.

Never auto-push to origin unless the user explicitly asks to push or create a PR. Committing locally is fine at completion points, but pushing is a deliberate action.

Pull Request Rules
Every PR body MUST reference the originating GitHub issue number (e.g., Fixes #16, Relates to #42).
When creating a PR, search open GitHub issues to find the matching ticket. If the branch was created from the Start Issue Workflow hook, the issue number should already be known from that workflow.
PR titles follow conventional commit format: fix: description, feat: description, chore: description.
Subagent / Delegated Task Rules
Subagents and delegated tasks MUST NEVER create new git branches, switch branches, or run git checkout. All work happens on whatever branch is currently checked out. The orchestrator (parent agent) owns all git operations.
Subagents MUST NEVER run git commit, git add, git stash, git branch, or any other git command. Only the orchestrator commits code. Subagents write files to disk — that's it.
When delegating tasks to subagents, the orchestrator MUST include this instruction: "Do NOT run any git commands. Do NOT create branches. Write files directly to the working directory."
Branch Scoping and Merge Checkpoints
Each feature branch should be scoped to a logical unit of work (e.g., feat/mvp-backend, feat/mvp-frontend). When the work for that scope is complete, push and create a PR before starting a new branch for the next scope.
Do NOT continue unrelated work on a branch after its scope is done. If backend work is finished on feat/mvp-backend, push and PR it first, then create feat/mvp-frontend for frontend work.
Before starting a new feature branch, always check the current branch with git branch --show-current. If you're on the wrong branch, switch to main first, then create the new branch.
After completing each task, evaluate whether the next task still belongs on the current branch. Ask: "Is the next task part of the same logical scope?" If not, commit what you have locally and create a new appropriately-named branch before continuing. Do NOT push or create a PR unless the user asks — just keep the local commit history clean.
Spec checkpoint tasks (e.g., "Ensure all tests pass") are natural commit points but NOT automatic push/PR points. Commit locally, then continue unless the user says to push or the scope is changing.
Node Modules and .gitignore
NEVER commit node_modules/ to git. The .gitignore file must include node_modules/ at all times.
When using git checkout to restore files from previous commits, NEVER restore node_modules/. Only restore specific source file paths.
Before any git add -A or git add ., always verify that node_modules/ is in .gitignore and not staged. Use git status to check if needed.
